AI Used - Claude, Bolt and Gemini
I have mastered the art of building any application using many AI models at once
1. First i explained about the tasks to claude ( how there is 40% criteria for ui) so, i made claude focus on UI and not more on functionality
2. Then i gave it a secons prompt asking it to add gsap scroll trigger and smooth scrolling
3. Now the UI was done(in just 2 prompts) then i came to bolt, and asked it to make a proper folder structure and also add the functionalities(new pages and popups when clicking buttons)
4. After that i tweaked it a bit asking it to make a contact us popup which is awesome
5. Then there were some bugs which i fixed using gemini
Here is my AI Usage report - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YYk5poz2Jlf1TRQjmu4q-LuGfiddH2sa7OUiL3uQwzY/edit?usp=sharing
